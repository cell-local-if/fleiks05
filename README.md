# Semantic State Engine

Semantic State Engine is a Python backend for building a distributed state system that can detect, explain, and repair semantic conflicts between independently updated replicas.

The current baseline is a small, runnable service boundary implemented with the Python standard library and requires Python 3.11 or newer.

## Current API

Run the service:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m semantic_state_engine.server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

`GET /health` returns HTTP 200 and a JSON object:

```json
{"service":"semantic-state-engine","status":"ok"}
```

Unknown routes return HTTP 404 with `{"error":"not_found"}`. Responses use UTF-8 JSON and include an explicit content length.

## Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
